YADAS
=====

This is a maven build of YADAS by Todd Graves:

 - http://www.stat.lanl.gov/yadas/node1.html

It is a build requirement for gertvv/mtc.

**Warning:** it seems the YADAS project is quite dead, as there have been no
updates to the source code since 2008, and a number of attempts to contact the
author in 2009/2010 have failed.
